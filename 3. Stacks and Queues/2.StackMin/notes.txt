SO SO SO,

This problem took me approximately two hours (with distracitons)

I sort of understood the main idea of what I wanted to do. More or less how I wanted to execute
the functions.
After taking a look at the last hint it really cemented the idea in my head.

I ended up having to create two classes, one for the node, one for the stack of nodes
The node itself tracks the data, and the stack is made of those nodes.

I have a knowledge gap for creating classes and and structures.
Looking up a stack data structure helped me understand how I was gonna make my solution.
I will admit, most of the code was retrieved from 
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-a-stack-using-singly-linked-list/

My work was mainly lines 22-28.
I thought I would take the time to get practice working with classes and functions.
Thats my main take away.
