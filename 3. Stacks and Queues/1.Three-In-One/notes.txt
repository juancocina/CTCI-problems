I'm going to attempt to translate the code for a flexible multistack in the CTCI book.
One thing that I don't really understand right now is the classes, as well as private and public
functions in the solution. 

So, thats one of my goals for this. Understanding the creation of classes and functions and why they
are either made public or private. 


I found a resource on github that has already done the translation.
One difference is that the github version doesn't have a class inside a class like CTCI does.
There is no "StackInfo".
When I tried translating it myself, I found that I had trouble declaring lines 39 and 40,
since it was being used earlier, in lines 17, 22.

The solution that I found online is missing a lot of functions.
    -  push is missing the shift if full
    - pop looks fine
    - peek?
    - shift is missing
    - expand is missing
    - numberOfElements, which i think is stackCapacityUsed for us
    - allStacksAreFull i think is missing
    - adjustIndex is missing
    - nextIndex is missing 
    - previousIndex is missing 

They got the Fixed Division solution nailed down pretty nicely though
I think this opens up the path for the second approach 

Its probably possible to build up approach #2 based off what I already have down.
